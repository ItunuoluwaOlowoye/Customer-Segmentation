# Customer Segmentation
Emporium is a vibrant department store bustling with different types of shoppers. This customer segmentation model paint a picture of these unique customer segments *(based on their purchasing habits, interactions with competitors, preferred product categories, and preferred shopping methods)*, revealing their quirks and preferences, and providing insights into marketing strategies to retain these customers.

This repository contains two notebooks:
1. [Model Codebase](https://github.com/ItunuoluwaOlowoye/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Model%20Codebase.ipynb): The notebook to build the customer segmentation model using K-means and K-modes algorithms.
2. [Insights Report](https://github.com/ItunuoluwaOlowoye/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Insights%20Report.ipynb): The notebook with a summary of the customer segments

The model was deployed with Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://customer-segmentation-itee.streamlit.app/). If the app has gone to sleep, simply wake it up.
